Original version of '2048' made by <b> Gabriele Cirulli </b> available <a href="https://2048.love2dev.com">here</a> used as reference.

<p>
The aim of this game is to join the tiles to get the highest number possible.

        </label>
    <label style="position: relative;">Score:
        </label> 
    <div id="plus"></div>
</div>

<p>
Though the name of the game is 2048, theoritically, the highest number possible is 65536 in our version of the game. The original version made by Gabriele Cirulli randomly gives you a '4' instead of a '2' as the starting number taking the theoritical maximum to 131072 assuming the last digit spawned is a '4'.
